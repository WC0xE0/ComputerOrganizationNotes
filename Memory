Memory Hierachy (from fast to slow): 

Registers
Cache
Main memory (RAM) 
Secondary memory (hard disk drive: magnetic or solid state)
Tertiary memory
Off-line bulk memory

——— 6.5 Virtual Memory

•Cache memory enhances performance by providing faster memory access speed. <Time>
•Virtual memory enhances performance by providing greater memory capacity, without the expense of adding main memory. <Space>


•A portion of a hard disk drive serves as an extension of main memory (RAM).
•If a system uses paging, virtual memory partitions main memory into individually managed page frames, that are written (or paged) to disk when they are not immediately needed.


•A physical address is the actual memory address of physical memory.
•Programs create virtual addresses that are mapped to physical addresses by the *memory manager. (*OS has memory manager, file manager, etc. )
•Page faults occur when a logical address requires that a page be brought in from disk.
•Memory fragmentation occurs when the paging process results in the creation of small, unusable clusters of memory addresses.


•Main memory and virtual memory are divided into equal sized pages.
•The entire address space required by a process need not be in memory at once. Some parts can be on disk, while others are in main memory.
•Further, the pages allocated to a process do not need to be stored contiguously-- either on disk or in memory.
•In this way, only the needed pages are in memory at any time, the unnecessary pages are in slower disk storage.
