5.2 Instruction Formats

Instruction sets are differentiated by the following:
•Number of bits per instruction.
•Stack-based or register-based. <operand storage>
•Number of explicit operands per instruction.
    - eg. for MARIE the max number of operands is 1
•Operand location.
    - eg. for MARIE the operand is located in RAM
•Types of operations.
•Type and size of operands.

ISA are measured by:
•Main memory space occupied by a program.
•Instruction complexity.
•Instruction length (in bits).
•Total number of instructions in the instruction set.

In designing an instruction set, consideration is given to:
•Instruction length.
	–Whether short, long, or variable.
•Number of operands.
•Number of addressable registers.
•Memory organization.
	–Whether byte- or word- addressable.
•Addressing modes.
	–Choose any or all: immediate, direct, indirect or indexed.

Byte ordering, or endianness, is another major architectural consideration.
•If we have a two-byte integer
- In little endian machines, the least significant byte is followed by the most significant byte. [L][MSB]
- Big endian machines store the most significant byte first (at the lower address). [MSB][L]
