4.6 Memory Organization and Addressing

•Concepts:
- Computer memory consists of a linear array of addressable storage cells that are similar to registers.
- Memory can be byte-addressable, or word-addressable, where a word typically consists of two (16 bits) or more bytes.
- Memory is constructed of RAM chips, often referred to in terms of length x width.
- If the memory word size of the machine is 16 bits, then a 4M x 16 RAM chip gives us 4 megabytes of 16-bit memory locations.

•How does the computer access a memory location corresponds to a particular address?
- We observe that 4M can be expressed as 2^2 x 2^20 = 2^22 words.
- Memory locations for this memory are numbered 0 through 2 22 - 1.
- Thus, the memory bus of this system requires at least 22 address lines:
    - The address lines “count” from 0 to 222 - 1 in binary. 
    - Each line is either “on” or “off” indicating the location of the desired memory element.

•Physical memory usually consists of more than one RAM chip.
•Access is more efficient when memory is organized into banks of chips with the addresses interleaved across the chips

eg. 32K memory in 4 banks
32K = 2^5 * 2^10 = 2^15 --> 15 bits needed to represent the memory address
32k = 8k per bank * 4 banks
8k = 2^3*2^10 = 2^13 --> 13 bits for offset inside each module
15 - 13 = 2 --> 2 bits to select 1 of the 4 banks
------------------------------------------
2 bits	| 13 bits
module number	| offset in module
select the chip/bank | offset on chip/bank
-------------------------------------------
*this example is high-order memory interleaving
*which means the module number is in high order bits

*there's also low-order memory interleaving.
